## Indian-Start-up-Funding-project

The goal of this project is to analyze the funding received by startups in India from 2018 to 2021 and to propose the best course of action for my team of Investors who want to venture in the Indian Ecosystem. The data for each year of funding is found in separate csv files. These files are what I’m going to use in asking my questions, stating my hypothesis, cleaning and analyzing my data.
