# # INDIAN START UP FUNDING PROJECT LP1
# 
# ### The goal of this project is to analyze the funding received by startups in India from 2018 to 2021. The data for each year of funding is found in separate csv files. These files are what Iâ€™m going to use in asking my questions, stating my hypothesis, cleaning my data and analyzing my data.
# 
# 
# ### QUESTIONS
# ### 1. Who are the top funded start-ups in India?
# ### 2. Which cities are most favoured by investors?
# ### 3. How does the funding change in time?
# ### 4. Which year records the most start-ups funded?
# ### 5. Which sectors do investors prefer?
# 
# 
# ### HYPOTHESIS
# ### 1. Investors prefer to invest in Tech start-ups more than the other start ups
# ### 2. The location of a start-up is a major factor in receiving funds from Investors.

# # DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION

# ### The libraries I am going to use for my analysis and visualization have already been imported at the start of my data cleaning. They are matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

# # Q1. WHO ARE THE TOP FUNDED STARTUPS IN INDIA?

# In[58]:


x = Merged_Data['Company/Brand'].value_counts()[:10].index
y = Merged_Data['Company/Brand'].value_counts()[:10].values
plt.bar(x,y)
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (20,10)
plt.xticks(fontsize = 15)
plt.yticks(fontsize = 15)
plt.title('TOP FUNDED START-UPS IN INDIA', fontsize = 19, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.xlabel('Start-ups', fontsize = 19, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.ylabel('Amount received', fontsize = 19, fontweight = 'bold')


# ### From the chart, we can see that BharatPe is the top funded startup in the Indian Ecosystem. Bharat is a fintech start up founded in 2018 and has it's HeadQuarter located in Delhi, India. Zomato falls next in place as the next top funded start-up in India.

# # Q2. Which cities are the most favoured by Investors?
# 

# ### For this analysis, I am going to use a pie chart to demonstrate the cities that are most favored by investors.

# In[59]:


fig1 = go.Figure(
    data=go.Pie(values=Merged_Data['HeadQuarter'].value_counts()[:8].values,labels=Merged_Data['HeadQuarter'].value_counts()[:8].index,title='Percentage of cities in every sector'))
fig1.show()


# ### From the illustration above, it is evident that investors prefer start-ups that come up from Bangalore city in India with a percentage of 38.9%. The graph clearly tells us why Bangalore is called the Silicon Valley State of India. The second most favored city is Mumbai, which has a percentage of 21.2%.
# 

# # Q3 . How does the funding change in time?

# In[61]:


c = list(Merged_Data.groupby(Merged_Data['Funding Year']).sum()['Amount in USD'])
d = list(Merged_Data['Funding Year'].value_counts().index.sort_values())
sns.scatterplot(d,c)
plt.plot(d,c)
plt.xlabel('Year', fontsize = 22, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.ylabel('Amount(USD) in billions', fontsize = 22, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.xticks(fontsize = 15)
plt.yticks(fontsize = 15)
plt.title('Amount Funded over the Years', fontsize = 22, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (20,10)
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


# ### From the plot above, we can tell that, funding has increased positively over time. Amount funded was stable from year 2018 to 2019 and increases from year 2019 to 2020, and further increases from year 2020 to 2021. This proves that investors invest in the Indian start up more and more as the years go by.
# 

# # Q4. Which year records the most start-ups funded?

# In[62]:


sns.countplot(Merged_Data['Funding Year'])
plt.xticks(fontsize = 15)
plt.yticks(fontsize = 15)
plt.xlabel('Year', fontsize = 22, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.ylabel('No. of Startups Funded', fontsize = 22, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.title('No of Startups Funded Over the Years', fontsize = 22, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18,8)
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


# ### From the graph above, it is clear that 2021 received the most start up funding. 2019 recorded the least funding.

# # Q5. Which Sectors do Investors prefer?

# In[63]:


plt.figure(figsize = (25,18))
sns.barplot(y = group_by_sector[:10].index, x = group_by_sector[:10].values)
plt.xticks(fontsize = 17)
plt.yticks(fontsize = 17)
plt.xlabel("Number of Investors", fontsize = 24, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.ylabel("Sector", fontsize = 24, fontweight = 'bold')
plt.title("SECTORS PREFERRED BY INVESTORS", fontsize = 24, fontweight = 'bold')


# # Summary 

# ### 1. The top funded start ups in the Indian Start-up ecosystem are BharatePe, Zomato and Zetwerk
# 
# ### 2. Bangalore, known as the Silicon Valley State of India, is the most preferred city by Investors. Followed by Mumbai.
# 
# ### 3. 2021 records the year with the most start ups funded
# 
# ### 4. Investors prefer to invest more in Tech start-up companies.
# 
# 
# 
# # Conclusion
# 
# ### To satisfy my hypothesis, 
# 
# 
# ### 1. Investors prefer to invest in Tech start-ups more than the other start ups.
# 
# ### This is clearly stated in Fig 5. Investors prefer to invest in Tech start-ups. Looking at the chart, more than 3 start ups are from the tech sector, with Fintech being at the top, followed by Edtech. 
# 
# 
# ### 2. The Location of a start-up plays a major role in receiving funds from Investors
# 
# ### Yes they do. According to this survey start-ups in Bangalore alone have got more funding than the next 6 cities in line put together. This could also be owing to the fact that Bangalore has the most number of start-ups in the country.
